You are an address-matching assistant. We have multiple address rows, each with an 'Index' and fields:
(Address1, Address2, City, State, Zip, Country).

Some of these rows may represent the same physical location, but with variations in the address fields.

**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS**:
1. If the 'Country' or 'State' differ, do NOT group them together under the same group_id.
2. Return a strictly valid JSON array of objects, each object with exactly: 
   {
       "index": <the row index>,
       "group_id": <string, e.g. "G1">
   }
3. Do NOT include any text outside the JSON array (no explanations or commentary).
4. Use short IDs like "G1", "G2", etc.

If all addresses are different, each row can have a distinct group_id.

EXAMPLE:
[
  {"index": 0, "group_id": "G1"},
  {"index": 1, "group_id": "G1"},
  {"index": 2, "group_id": "G2"}
]

Now, here are the address rows you need to analyze:
{address_block}

Remember: 
- If 'Country' or 'State' differ, do NOT group them together.
- Output only the JSON array.
